# CV-Drive
Develop a computer vision (CV) based system that detects hand gestures and maps them to the "W", "A", "S", and "D" keys, enabling users to play games using hand movements instead of a traditional keyboard.

Key Components:

Hand Detection:

Use a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., MediaPipe Hands by Google or a custom-trained model) to detect and track the user's hand in real-time.
Implement hand landmark detection to identify key points on the hand, such as fingertips and joints.
Gesture Recognition:

Define specific hand gestures corresponding to the "W", "A", "S", and "D" keys. For example:
"W" for moving forward: a hand gesture with the palm facing the camera and fingers extended.
"A" for moving left: a hand gesture with the palm facing the camera and fingers pointing left.
"S" for moving backward: a hand gesture with the palm facing the camera and fingers curled into a fist.
"D" for moving right: a hand gesture with the palm facing the camera and fingers pointing right.
Train a gesture recognition algorithm (e.g., using a convolutional neural network or support vector machine) to classify these gestures based on the detected hand landmarks.
Key Mapping:

Map the recognized gestures to the corresponding keyboard inputs ("W", "A", "S", "D").
Use a library such as pynput in Python to simulate key presses based on the detected gestures.
Integration and Testing:

Integrate the hand detection, gesture recognition, and key mapping modules into a cohesive system.
Test the system with various games that use the "W", "A", "S", "D" keys for movement to ensure accuracy and responsiveness.
Technologies and Tools:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras, pynput
Hardware: Webcam for capturing hand movements
